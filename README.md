# Linear Regression Project: Mobile App vs Website Focus
## Introduction
This repository is a linear regression project that aims to determine whether the company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. The project involves analyzing a dataset of customer behavior to identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.

## Contents
- Imports: Required libraries and packages are imported.

- Data: The dataset used for this project is loaded and analyzed.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is explored to understand its distribution, correlation, and trends.

- Training and Testing Data: The dataset is split into training and testing data to train and evaluate the model.

- Training the Model: A linear regression model is trained on the training data to predict the target variable.

- Predicting Test Data: The model is used to predict the target variable for the test data.

- Residuals: The residuals are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the model.

- Conclusion: The results are analyzed, and a conclusion is drawn on whether the company should focus on the mobile app or the website.
